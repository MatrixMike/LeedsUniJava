# LeedsUniJava
some examples from Leeds Uni (England) (year 2000 printing) and some other good stuff from Oracle Tutorials.

These work well with my newly found teach/learn IDE Bluej - wonderful stuff -
can 'see' into code and execute parts without doing the whole package project thing - a bit like Java9

Remember to do javadoc ... -private [ this works well with *.java in place of ... ]

adding package statement requires that the source code by placed in a folder with the same name as the package.
